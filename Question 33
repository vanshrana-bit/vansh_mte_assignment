33.   Explain the sliding window technique and its applications in array problems ?
Ans.  The Sliding Window Technique is a powerful approach used to solve array and string problems 
      efficiently, especially when dealing with contiguous subarrays or substrings.

      It's a way to reduce time complexity by avoiding unnecessary re-computation when working with subarrays or subsequences of a given size.
      -Instead of recalculating everything from scratch, we:
      -Start with a "window" (a range of elements).
      Slide it across the array by adding the next element and removing the first.

      üîç Applications of Sliding Window Technique
      Problem Type	                Example
      Maximum/Minimum in subarrays	Sliding Window Maximum (with Deque)
      Sum problems	                Max/Min sum of k-sized subarray
      String problems	              Longest substring with/without repeating characters
      Pattern matching	            Anagram detection
      Frequency or count in range	  Count of distinct elements in window
      Optimization problems	        Min/Max window satisfying a condition
