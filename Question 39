39. Explain the difference between subsets and permutations with examples.
Ans. ðŸ§© 1. Subsets vs Permutations:
            Feature	              Subsets	                                              Permutations
            Definition	          Any combination of elements (order doesn't matter)	  Arrangements of elements (order matters)
            Order	                 Not important	                                      Important
            Duplicates allowed?	  No duplicates in final result	                        All unique arrangements
            Length of results	    Varying lengths (0 to n)	                            Fixed length (n for n elements)
            Total count	          2^n subsets for n elements	                          n! permutations for n elements
