7. Explain the sliding window technique and its use in string problems.
Ans. The sliding window is a method used to reduce the time complexity of problems involving contiguous sequences (subarrays or substrings).
     Instead of checking every possible substring (which is often O(nÂ²)), the sliding window "slides" over the string/array and keeps track of only the necessary information, usually in O(n) time.

    - Basic Idea:
    Maintain a window using two pointers: start and end.
    
    Slide the end pointer to expand the window.
    
    If the condition is violated (like duplicate character, or sum > k):
    
    Slide the start pointer to shrink the window and fix it.
    
    Keep track of the result while traversing.

    - Use in String:
    Because many string problems involve finding substrings that satisfy certain properties, such as:

    Unique characters
    
    Specific length or pattern
    
    Character frequencies
    
    The sliding window helps optimize these checks efficiently.
